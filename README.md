# Personal Learnings

This website is a single page news site that allows users to filter top news stories via the New York Times API. The purpose of this project was to fetch data from the NYT API and append it to the page using a grid method. 

The main purpose of this project was to make an Ajax request to fetch data from The New York Times API, populate the page with the returned data according to the userâ€™s selected category, and handle the outcome should the request fail. Furthermore this was also the first project in which I used a preprocessor (SASS), taskrunner (Gulp) and  version control (Git/GitHub).
